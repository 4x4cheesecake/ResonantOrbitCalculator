Kopernicus has a setting to save memory which interferes with the initial
functioning of this mod, specifically, the creation of the planet images in a
cache.


Thanks to forum user @Gordon Dry for the following:

    Disable Kopernicus onDemand where you find it:
    	%useOnDemand = False
    	%useManualMemoryManagement = False
        
    Don't forget to reenable it after the testing.
    
    Delete the files in
    GameData\ResonantOrbitCalculator\PluginData\Cache\
    then start the game one time.
    Get to the Main Menu, wait a minute and then exit the game.
    
    --
    
    The cache files will not be overwritten once created, so you could set up 
    a test install with only the planets, make a backup of the created cache 
    and then copy the cache directly over on reinstalling the mod.
    
    You need at least:
    
        000_ClickThroughBlocker\
        001_ToolbarControl\
        CTTP\
        EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements\
        Kopernicus\
        ModularFlightIntegrator\
        ResonantOrbitCalculator\
        Squad\
    
    plus everything what belongs to the planet pack, like for example for RSS with RSSVE:

        KSCSwitcher\
        RealSolarSystem\
        RSSDateTime\
        RSS-Textures\
        RSSVE\
